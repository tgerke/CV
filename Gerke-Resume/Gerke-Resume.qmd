section-four: Summary & Objective
section-four-text: |
  As a practictioner of servant leadership, I balance roles as an independent contributor against that of a full stack data science mentor. I use my experience as a former academic to guide best research and data practice in  oncology clinical trials and the real-world evidence domain.
