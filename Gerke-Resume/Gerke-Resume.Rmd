# Education
\emph{Summary:} I am jointly trained as a statistician and epidemiologist. I apply these skills as a data science leader to guide data collection strategies (epidemiology) that will enable optimal insights and robust decision-making from downstream consumption (statistical translation).

# Experience and impact
\emph{Summary:} My career as a quantitative scientist spans not only the traditional principal investigator role, but also includes administrative leadership in the data science domain. I have led or collaborated on 14 successful grant applications, many of which helped drive my 70+ peer-reviewed publications. My team science efforts have resulted in over 60 scientific conference presentations, both nationally and internationally. I have also led or co-developed 5 scientific software releases.

# Advisory roles, mentorship, and outreach
\emph{Summary:} As a result of my deep appreciation for modernized data governance, scientific computing, and reproducible data science frameworks, I provide strategic input for a wide array of relevant organizational initiatives. Successful implementation of such initiatives requires undertanding the needs and partnership/mentoring of data science end-users. As an active and visible member of the broader data science community, I enjoy sharing successes/challenges and learning from the experience of others.

# Technical experience
\emph{Summary:} My philosphy on appropriate technology tooling is to use that which most efficiently delivers interpretable value to key stakeholders. This stance guides my regular usage and enthusiam for R/RStudio solutions which feature a full statistical toolkit with deliverables commonly designed for the modern web browser. I also have experience in cloud and/or high-performance computing cluster environments, where key stakeholders may be other data scientists who place high value on efficiency at scale; in such settings, I have deployed Python, SAS, or SQL (often through R database interfaces) as appropriate. In all technical work, I emphasize that reproduciblity and readability for future users of code is of paramount importance, with git playing a vital role in this regard.
