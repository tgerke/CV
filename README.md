## CV / Resume

This repository contains my full academic CV [here](https://github.com/tgerke/CV/blob/master/GerkeCV.pdf) and my 2-page resume [here](https://github.com/tgerke/CV/blob/master/Gerke-Resume/Gerke-Resume.pdf)

### Development notes
If you'd to use the academic CV LaTeX template, note that it must be compiled with XeLaTeX. The resume is built with the incredible [Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) package.
